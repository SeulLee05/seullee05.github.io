## About Me
***
I'm a M.S. student at [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI)](https://www.mlai-kaist.com) lab in KAIST, under the supervision of Prof. Sung Ju Hwang. I obtained my B.S. degrees (Aerospace Engineering, Biological Sciences) at KAIST.<br>
My research interest includes deep drug discovery, generative models, and graph neural networks.
